                How the pandemic affected my life
            </h3>
            <p class="introduction">
                The sudden outbreak of pandemic and lockdown of states caused people to panic however but at first i was happy, I mean i can do whatever i like however i like.
            </p>
            <p class="body">
                In the starting two weeks i lived my life as a king, but at the starting of third week I was getting more and more bored. Sure I can play games or watch movies but there is always a limit.
                so a friend of mine suggested programing and I said "sure I could try that" and it was the best thing in my life I absolutely loved programing so i started learning web development and much more.
            </p>
            <p class="conclusion">
                So this pandemic and lockdown was very beneficial for me as started learning programing and im very grateful for each and every person that helped me, motivated me
